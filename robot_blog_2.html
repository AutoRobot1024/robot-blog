<p dir="auto">We will give you some brief introduction of what are parrallel robots and why they are trending research topics</p>
<p dir="auto">Firstly, congratulations on entering an interesting and challenging field. The research on parallel robots is essentially the study of spatial mechanism, and further it is the derivation of pure mathematical formulas. The research content in this field mainly includes the configuration design of mechanisms, kinematic analysis, dynamic modeling, performance analysis, parameter optimization, motion control, and scenario applications (mainly machine tools, human rehabilitation, and joint design). Professor Huang Zhen from Yanshan University is one of the older generation of scholars in China who first studied parallel robots. Currently, many experts in the field of parallel robots have emerged from Yanshan University, such as Professor Liu Xinjun from Tsinghua University, who specializes in performance analysis and the design of parallel machine tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">I can only say that I have given up my imagination about which direction parallel robots are easy to achieve results in. If you have not been exposed to parallel mechanisms during your master's degree, then you will need to spend more energy researching, deducing, and struggling during your doctoral studies. The DH method is still used for the analysis of ordinary serial robots, but a mathematical tool called spinor theory is used for parallel robots. Although parallel robots are a niche research direction, theoretical research on them has basically reached a bottleneck. Better journals now hardly accept articles on kinematics and dynamics analysis because this area has been explored in various ways, including performance analysis. Professor Sun Tao's team at Tianjin University has already created a mechanism library for configuration analysis. So the research direction depends on which direction your supervisor is studying, whether there is a research foundation and previous achievements.</p>
<p dir="auto">This field is interesting and challenging, give up fantasies and strive to delve deeper. If possible, try to move towards the direction of control, find opportunities for cross school communication as much as possible, and avoid working alone as much as possible. A doctoral graduation definitely requires physical objects and experiments. In the early stage, it is important to do a good job in configuration design, not mechanism design. This is crucial in determining the success or failure of subsequent experiments. Finally, regarding journals, scholars in this field generally submit to a few journals such as MMT (Mechanical and Mechanical Theory) and Journal of Mechanical Engineering. The articles written will always be accepted by those who submit more.</p>
<p dir="auto">If the scope of the definition of the achievement is only limited to the paper, then the research on systems with special mechanism forms such as flexible linkage parallel systems and line driven parallel systems in the field of parallel robots may be more novel and the problems to be solved will be more complex. Such articles are currently easier to produce than traditional rigid multi axis parallel robots, but it will be difficult to make and control the physical system well. Many papers are still in the simulation stage.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compared with the current popular direction of robots, "large model driven robots", it can be found that more and more research works are becoming systematic, and task scenarios are becoming more and more clear. Especially this year, some research on the application of VLM and LLM in the field of medical robots was reviewed on IROS. Although pre trained models are used, the completeness of task scenarios and the concretization of system modules are becoming stronger, and it is no longer the modular work of RL Robot for human-machine collaboration that was done ten years ago.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the increasingly close integration of computer vision processing, multimodal sensing, and robot body mechanisms, the publication space for research on a single mechanism or method may be compressed. It is still necessary to integrate modular work into large systems and find suitable research backgrounds in order to improve the value and survival cycle of research work.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is relatively little research on parallel robots, and they are also rarely used (in terms of scenarios). If we want to do it, Delta will take the time to get it done first.</p>
<p dir="auto">Forgive my ignorance, if there is a hotspot for robots, it is definitely not in parallel robots.</p>
<p dir="auto">In recent years, the hottest topic for robots has been biomimetics: from dogs and kangaroos to cockroaches and ants, from crawling snakes and earthworms to fish in the water, birds in the sky, and insects in the ground. Not a single one has been spared, and SCI is basically stable.</p>
<p dir="auto">I also want to say that cable driven parallel robots use ropes instead of rigid links, which can change the geometric structure and have many application scenarios. They are suitable for equipment manufacturing, medical rehabilitation, aerospace and other fields, and are very suitable for operating tasks in constrained environments.
The paper 'Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance for Cable Driven Parallel Robots With Mobile Bases via Sim to Real Reinforcement Learning' was published in the SCI&amp;EI indexed journal IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.</p>
